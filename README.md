# algorithms-practice
My practice with different basic algorithms, why not?

### Usage
Just clone this repo, run `composer install` and then `./tests/run.sh`.

### Table of contents
* Factorial (recursive)
* Array sum (recursive)
* Binary search
* Selection sorting
* Quick sorting (recursive)
* Breadth-first search (search shortest path in unweighted not oriented graph, BFS)
* Dijkstra's search (search shortest path in weighted oriented graph, SPF)
* Set cover problem algorithm
